# Roxie Plugin for Errbot

Errbot is a python based chatbot that connects to your favorite chat service and brings your tools into the conversation. This plug-in extends Errbot's architecture to bring Roxie, Rubrik's intelligent personal assistant into the fold. Utilizing the Roxie Plugin for Errbot allows organizations to integrate common cloud data management tasks into their preferred collobaration platforms, granting end-users to chat or query the plugin in order to perform functions through simple conversation such as:

- Assigning an SLA Domain to a Rubrik object
- Taking an on-demand snapshot of a Virtual Machine
- Performing a Live Mount of a Virtual Machine

The Rubrik Plugin for Errbot will interpret the natural conversation and peform the respective API calls to a Rubrik cluster in order to perform the requested functionality.
