# Rubrik Plugin for Errbot

Errbot is a Python-based chatbot that connects to your favorite chat service, bringing your tools into the conversation. This plug-in extends Errbot's architecture to bring Roxie, Rubrik's intelligent personal assistant, into the fold. Utilizing the Rubrik Plugin for Errbot allows organizations to integrate common cloud data management tasks into their preferred collaboration platforms, granting end-users the ability to chat or query the plugin in order to perform functions through simple conversation such as:

* Assigning an SLA Domain to a Rubrik object
* Taking an on-demand snapshot of a Virtual Machine
* Performing a Live Mount of a Virtual Machine

The Rubrik Plugin for Errbot will interpret the natural conversation and perform the respective API calls to a Rubrik cluster in order to perform the requested functionality.

## :white_check_mark: Prerequisites

There are a few services you'll need in order to get this project off the ground:

* [Errbot](https://errbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - the plugin requires the Errbot framework
* Rubrik CDM 4.0 or later - the platform that protects provisioned workloads

Depending on the chat/collaboration platform you intend to use additional plugins or connectors may be required. For example, using the Rubrik Plugin for Errbot with Mattermost additionally requires:

* [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) - High Trust Messaging for the Enterprise
* [Errbot Backend for Mattermost](https://github.com/Vaelor/errbot-mattermost-backend) - Connects Mattermost to Errbot
